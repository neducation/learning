# Sand Tetris

A mobile-friendly iOS sand tetris game with realistic gravity effects, tiny animated sand particles, and advanced line-clearing mechanics.

## Features

- **20x More Blocks**: Ultra-fine grid with 72x144 cells for detailed sand simulation
- **Animated Sand Physics**: Individual sand particles fall with realistic gravity and acceleration
- **Advanced Line Clearing**: Same-colored particles must form a connected line from wall to wall
- **Smooth 60fps Animation**: Fluid particle movement and falling animations
- **iOS Mobile Optimized**: Touch controls, responsive design, and iOS-specific optimizations
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Speed increases as you clear more lines

## How to Play

### Controls

**Touch Controls (Mobile):**

- **Swipe Left/Right**: Move piece horizontally

### Gameplay

1. **Falling Pieces**: Large colored sand tetris pieces fall from the top
2. **Particle Physics**: After placing a piece, individual sand particles fall with realistic gravity and acceleration
3. **Connected Line Clearing**: Same-colored particles must form a continuous connected path from wall to wall to disappear
4. **Advanced Gravity**: After line clearing, remaining sand falls down naturally with smooth animation
5. **Scoring**: Earn points for placing pieces, clearing lines, and hard drops
6. **Level Up**: Speed increases every 10 lines cleared

### Sand Physics

- **Tiny Particles**: 20x more detail with ultra-small sand grains
- **Realistic Falling**: Sand particles fall straight down when possible with gravity acceleration
- **Diagonal Sliding**: Particles slide diagonally left or right when blocked
- **Smooth Animation**: 60fps particle animation for fluid movement
- **Connected Lines**: Only same-color particles touching each other from wall to wall will clear
